# ICS 6B - LaTeX Templates
Basic LaTeX template files for ICS 6B (Gassko)

# Warning 
I just started learning LaTeX so the templates included may have errors and poor practices. These are meant for you to get started with LaTeX in this class. 

# How to Use It
I personally recommend using Overleaf which is an online and free LaTeX editor. 
```
1. Go to https://www.overleaf.com/ and make a new account & project
2. Create a new LaTeX file (top left)
3. Go back to this page and click on "learningBasics.tex" 
4. Copy-paste the entire thing into the new LaTeX file you just created
5. Take a look at the sample LaTeX file that Overleaf creates for you to learn more
6. (OPTIONAL) Make a new LaTeX file and copy "myTemplate.tex" into it 
7. (OPTIONAL) Make a new LaTeX file and copy "symbols.tex" into it
